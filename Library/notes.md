## Algorithms
* Kadane's Algorithm for finding Max sum subarray
* Sieve Alogorigthm for Fast Prime factorization
* Mo's Alogorithm for tree flatening

## Data Structures
* Segment Trees for Fast subarray queries
* Prefix sum array for for finding sub array sums quickly

## Tricks
* All divisors of a number can be found by multiplying power of its prime factors
* Difference of two squares => p^2 - q^2 = x, x is either odd, zero or divisible by 4
